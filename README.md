### Overview
Takes data from back-end and prints it onto our front-end

## What I learned
- Express is a framework for node
- Nodemon allows the server to be updated with every change automatically
- starting our backend can be done using: app.listen(x, msg);
- We can define a proxy, which allows us not to write the host url when fetching
- We can use typeof to make a conditional statement
